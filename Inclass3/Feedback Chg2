If looks like you're still working on 2.3 and 2.4? I can't run your 2.1&2.2 code since it depends on another file, alwasy include the necessary programs if you refer to them. Also, don't use characters like &*#@ in the names of your programs, it will definitely cause problems, if not now, then later.

I'm happy with 2.3 and 2.4 except that your program doesn't print the altitude where the two gravitational assumptions diverge by 1% that you supposedly find - I'll look into that. You also need tweak the graphs in 2.1 and 2.2, they should look very similar, the rk4 methods should converge just a bit faster. (There shouldn't be multiple lines printed, we're looking at the value of the temperature at a specific time vs the step number, not time anymore.)
