Finally getting around to HW4:
On problem 1, it appears that your autocorrelation test fails pretty badly, but you said it passed, why? What value should the autocorr have?
On problem 2, you've nailed down the relation between acceptance rate and the step delta, but you didn't seem to address anything to do with the the equilibration time. This IS a fuzzy concept, but you should try to address it in your code.
