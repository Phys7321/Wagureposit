HW01-Differences, Derivatives, and Python Oh My

Lots of areas that still need to be worked on with this one:

1. Only the first case has extensions into reading at multiple points for python
2. Could not figure out how to get gradient to work in matlab (I think I need to somehow get it to evaluate without giving the results)
3. Extend into 3D for each one (just adding a z-component)
4. Lots of issues with rcos(phi) matlab edition
