# Wagureposit
HW01-Differences, Derivatives, Oh My

wagder and wagmyder for the rewrites

Function written in spyder, imported the x data to use as a sample wasn't certain about that

did X and Y derivatives in matlab using diff function, which is probably wrong **(Don't be so negative, as I said in class, without interpolation - diff is the best you're going to do with data)**

As far as the python code, I'd like to run it, but you have to include 'derdata.txt'. You should always make sure that you can run your programs with the files included in your repositories. Push this file up and I'll run it.
