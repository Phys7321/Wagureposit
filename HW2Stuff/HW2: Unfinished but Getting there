Major Issues:
      1. rcos(phi) matlab
      2. gradient matlab (how to get to not evaluate constants but still do the integral?)
      3. Python needs to expand to more than just base point analysis (random # generator)
      
Glaring Problems:
      1. No 3D
      2. Linear only y=x
      3. Plotting
      4. I dont trust the E
